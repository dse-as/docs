# Eine interessante Beobachtung

Der holocron-Editor scheint md-linting zu machen. Das war z.B. keine manuelle Bearbeitung, sondern geschah beim passiven Ã–ffnen der Datei: <https://github.com/dse-as/docs/commit/5ba1c3a5c28ba933cf666e655ca388f1220a9e17>

Hallo Welt

**Lorem Ipsum** is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type _specimen_ book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was _popularised_ in the **1960s** with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
